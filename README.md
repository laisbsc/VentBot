## Open a PR
Once your repository has successfully locally setup, you can start contributing to the main repo
with Pull Requests. To open a Pull Request:
- type `git checkout -b <name_of_your_branch>`. this will create a new branch and switch to it.
- make your changes; and remember: it is good practice to open PR to work on one feature (only) at each time.
- `git add` to add the files you are happy to have added to the PR.
- `git commit -m '<describe_your_PR>'` to commit (save) your changes remotely
- once you are ready to submit your work, type: `git push origin <destiny_branch>`
- click on the link returned by your terminal and :tada

Congratulations, you have just made your first PR!!!

## Sync your repo
- Once you have submitted your changes, switch to the main branch, `git fetch --all` of them
- and then `git pull upstream main` to sync your local repository to the main branch
> sometimes, the `dev` branch will be the one which should be pulled. But we cross that bridge when we get to it.
